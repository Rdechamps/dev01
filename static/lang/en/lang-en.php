SpaceClaim is the fruit of experts such as Michael Payne and Daniel Dean. These fathers of features based CAD technology have experienced huge global success when they launched Pro / Engineer and SolidWorks. 
Now with SpaceClaim, they break the yoke of the historic (tree) of construction in offering a 3D CAD freely accessible by all. 
With many advanced mechanical modeling features, they have associated also sheet metal functions of great reputation in order to also answer to the needs of sheet metal workers. To do this, they chose cataCAD, which, with its 30 years of experience in the field of sheet metal CAD and know - how, gave birth to the expert version of Sheet Metal without limit of SpaceClaim software.";

Indeed, the benefits of 3D design were reserved only to operators trained in the use of CAD. These traditional CAD were often too complex to leave the design offices .... Therefore, the functionality of the software remain inaccessible to the majority of people who contribute directly to the development, industrialization and manufacturing of products designed with CAD. This is often the case for manufacturing methods and services not working on 3D CAD sources but on 2D files inaccessible 3D view (single viewer) 3D.";
		
	$content['more-SMO-text-4'] = "Therefore, in order that all persons working upstream or downstream of the Design Office to share their ideas on 3D models, SpaceClaim company has developed a new generation of CAD. They created a 3D modeler new technology called \"Direct Modeling\" that allows modification of a 3D model regardless of how the model was created. To understand what this means, it is necessary to remember that to design a part, traditional 3D modelers (Pro / Engineer, CATIA, SolidWorks, etc.) are based on a sequence of functions (features) that are stacked one another, often represented as a tree, and each successive functionality and form the history of the creation of a 3D model.";
		
	$content['more-SMO-text-5'] = "Also, to be able to make changes, you must first understand that it was the logic of the construction used in the stacking of these functions. In contrast, with SpaceClaim, no used operations history is preserved, neither the method nor the methodology of construction, having no effect. Only the result counts to obtain the desired geometry. In addition, it adds ease to become familiar with the software. The software uses the latest features of Windows. It takes the Windows graphical interface. More so, the user interface is very simple.";

These formats, as well as neutral formats usable with most modelers on the market (STEP, IGES, SAT, XMT) are supported by the software. It is mainly in this sense that direct modeling technology offers the best of the best. The user is no longer constrained by conventional parametric design and can use simple functions presented by the two main modification tools: Pull and Move. The highly adaptive environment design allows you to take control of all aspects of the design and make changes that were not planned in advance. The system interprets in several ways for the user by recognizing what geometry is selected and in what context.
